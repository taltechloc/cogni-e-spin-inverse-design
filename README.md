# ðŸ”¬ eSpinID: Inverse Design Framework for Electrospun Nanofibers

**eSpinID** (**E**lectro**Spin**ning **I**nverse **D**esign) is a Python package that implements a robust, data-driven framework for predicting and controlling the diameter of electrospun nanofibers. It moves beyond traditional trial-and-error methods by integrating a high-fidelity surrogate model with advanced optimization techniques to determine the optimal process parameters for a specified target fiber diameter.

This package provides the core code supporting the findings in the manuscript:

Inverse Design of Electrospun Nanofibers: An XGBoost and PSO Framework for Targeted Diameter Control.
## ðŸŒŸ Core Methodology

The framework relies on a two-stage approach:

1.  **Surrogate Modeling:** An **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** model acts as a reliable "digital twin," predicting the fiber diameter from four key process parameters. XGBoost delivered the highest predictive accuracy with a testing $R^{2}$ of $0.896 \pm 0.06$.
2.  **Inverse Optimization:** The trained XGBoost model is integrated with **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**. The optimization routine finds the experimentally feasible input parameters that minimize the error between the model's prediction and the desired target diameter ($d_{target}$). PSO achieved the highest accuracy with an $R^{2}$ of $0.9942$ and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $\approx 1.16\text{ nm}$.

## ðŸ’» Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python (version 3.8 or higher) installed. Using a virtual environment is strongly recommended to manage dependencies.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

The package is hosted under the larger project name but is installed as `eSpinID`.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/taltechloc/cogni-e-spin-inverse-design.git](https://github.com/taltechloc/cogni-e-spin-inverse-design.git)
cd cogni-e-spin-inverse-design

```

### Step 2: Install the Package
Navigate to the specific installation directory and execute the installation script.

``` bach
cd package/install
./install_package.sh
```

### ðŸ’¾ Data Preparation for Reproducibility

The code requires the experimental data to be manually extracted from the cited publication and saved in a specific format for the model to train and validate.

Data Source
The experimental data (96 trials on poly(vinyl alcohol) or PVA) used to train the surrogate model was sourced from:

Ziabari, M., Mottaghitalab, V. & Haghi, A. process. A new approach for optimization of electrospun nanofiber formation process. Korean J. Chem. Eng.

 27(1), 340â€“354 (2010). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11814-009-0309-1 

Required Format
Extract the 96 experimental trials data (Table 1, Figure 2) from the source paper.

Save this data into a CSV file named data.csv (or similar name specified in your loading script).

The CSV file must contain the following columns, exactly matching the feature names used by the framework:

| Feature Name | Description                              |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| concentration | Solution Concentration (wt%)             |
| distance      | Tip-to-Collector Distance (cm)           |
| voltage       | Applied Voltage (kV)                     |
| flow_rate     | Feed Rate (mL/h)                         |
| diameter      | Target Output (Average Fiber Diameter (nm)) |

### ðŸ§ª Reproducing Manuscript Figures and Tables
All scripts necessary to rerun the full analysis, including EDA, regression model benchmarking, and optimization, are located in the main folder.

This folder contains:

Run Codes: Scripts to execute the core inverse design workflow.

Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): Files containing the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and benchmarking of the eleven regression models (Table 3, Figure 6).

Log Files: Detailed output logs for the optimization performance comparison.

The full analysis workflow includes:

Training and 5-fold cross-validation of all eleven regression models.

SHAP analysis on the XGBoost model (Figure 7), which confirmed applied voltage and solution concentration as the most influential factors.

Hyperparameter tuning and comparison of all seven optimization methods.
