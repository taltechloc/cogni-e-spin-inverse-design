# ðŸ”¬ eSpinID: Inverse Design Framework for Electrospun Nanofibers

**eSpinID** (**E**lectro**Spin**ning **I**nverse **D**esign) is a Python package that implements a robust, data-driven framework for predicting and controlling the diameter of electrospun nanofibers. It moves beyond traditional trial-and-error methods by integrating a high-fidelity surrogate model with advanced optimization techniques to determine the optimal process parameters for a specified target fiber diameter.

This package provides the core code supporting the findings in the manuscript:
*Inverse Design of Electrospun Nanofibers: An XGBoost and PSO Framework for Targeted Diameter Control*

## ðŸŒŸ Core Methodology

The framework relies on a two-stage approach:

1.  **Surrogate Modeling:** An **Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** model acts as a reliable "digital twin," predicting the fiber diameter from four key process parameters. XGBoost delivered the highest predictive accuracy with a testing $R^{2}$ of $0.896 \pm 0.06$.
2.  **Inverse Optimization:** The trained XGBoost model is integrated with **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**. The optimization routine finds the experimentally feasible input parameters that minimize the error between the model's prediction and the desired target diameter ($d_{target}$). PSO achieved the highest accuracy with an $R^{2}$ of $0.9942$ and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of $\approx 1.16\text{ nm}$.
